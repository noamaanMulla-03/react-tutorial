# React Tutorial

Welcome to the React Tutorial repository! This repository contains projects which I make in ReactJS.

## Project Structure

As of now, the repository is organized as follows:

- `expense-tracker`: This folder contains the Expense Tracker project. It helps you manage your expenses and track your spending. There is only frontend in this project and no backend

- `react-setup`: This folder contains the React Setup project. I only created this to practice making a component-based UI.

## Getting Started

To run each project locally, follow these instructions.

1. Open a terminal and navigate to the project directory.
2. Run `npm install` to install the project dependencies.
3. Run `npm start` to start the development server.

Feel free to explore each project's folders for more details.
